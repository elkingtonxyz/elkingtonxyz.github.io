  <p>A list of books that have been useful to me along the way. You differentiate yourself by the books you read.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77265004-the-iliad" target="_blank"><img class="book" src="iliad.jpg" alt="book-iliad" width="122" height="180" /></a><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77265004-the-iliad" target="_blank">Iliad</a></h3>

<p>Homer</p>

<p>A childhood classic. The Iliad is an ancient Greek epic poem that describes key events in the final weeks of the Trojan War, a legendary conflict between the Greeks and the city of Troy. The story centers around the Greek hero Achilles and his rage over losing his war prize, the maiden Briseis, to the Greek leader Agamemnon.</p>

<p>Sun Tzu</p>

<p>Is 500 plus pages about essentially one private equity deal interesting? You bet it is. Although a bit sensationalized, this book is well researched and written. It’s also somewhat settling that modern warfare is fought in boardrooms and proxy votes rather than cannon fire and bayonets. Reading this book will also drive home the fact that, like many things, private equity is more than a simple caricature of investors buying companies and firing people so they can buy bigger yachts.</p>

<p>Sam Walton</p>

<p>This is perhaps my all-time favorite business book even though it's an autobiography. Maybe because it's hard to separate Sam Walton from Walmart, it seems it's as much of a story of a business as it is a man. What is particularly impressive about the Sam Walton story is how seemingly straightforward it is -- build a good business, treat people well, and attain success. Like Warren Buffet, Walton shows how a few guiding principles followed for long periods of time can have a tremendous impact.</p>

<p>Dōgen</p>

<p>Don't let the cover fool you, this is pure gold. We recently re-read this at Applied and someone said this is like a 200 page description of our culture. I take that as a massive compliment. Designing a team is akin to designing a mechanical system. It is bound by factors like the laws of physics and material properties. Surely, before you would design a turbine, you would learn about fluids. However, people try to learn management on the fly. Don't wing it.</p>

<p>Jared M. Diamond</p>

<p>This is a must-read book if you are interested in how civilizations have developed and wonder about questions like "why are some countries rich and others poor?" It's much more dense and therefore rewarding than many pop-culture books that have come to dominate airport convenience shops.</p>
