<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77265004-the-iliad" target="_blank"><img class="book" src="iliad.jpg" alt="book-iliad" width="122" height="180" /></a><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77265004-the-iliad" target="_blank">Iliad</a></h3>

<p>Homer</p>

<p>A childhood classic. The Iliad is an ancient Greek epic poem that describes key events in the final weeks of the Trojan War, a legendary conflict between the Greeks and the city of Troy. The story centers around the Greek hero Achilles and his rage over losing his war prize, the maiden Briseis, to the Greek leader Agamemnon.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10534.The_Art_of_War" target="_blank"><img class="book" src="artofwar.jpg" alt="book-artofwar" width="122" height="180" /></a><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10534.The_Art_of_War" target="_blank">The Art of War</a></h3>

<p>Sun Tzu</p>

<p>Another childhood classic. The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise that dates back to the 5th century BC. It was written by the legendary military strategist Sun Tzu, whose actual name was Sun Wu. Little is known about Sun Tzu's life outside of the writings attributed to him. The text of "The Art of War" is composed of 13 chapters, each dedicated to a particular aspect of warfare strategy and tactics. Despite its age, it has had an enduring impact on both military strategy and global culture over the centuries. The central philosophy underlying Sun Tzu's teachings stresses the importance of positioning, stratagem, leverage, and understanding one's situation relative to the enemy as being preeminent in achieving victory. He advocated subduing opponents without direct conflict wherever possible through means like maneuvering, deception, diplomacy, and disrupting alliances.</p>

<p>Niccolò Machiavelli</p>

<p>A third childhood classic. The Prince is a 16th century political treatise by the Italian diplomat and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli. Believed to have been written around 1513, the work was not formally published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli's death. The book is a famous analysis of the acquisition and keeping of political power. Its tone is straightforward and seemingly amoral, as Machiavelli focuses on practical "realpolitik" rather than idealistic outlooks. This revolutionary perspective on politics made the book controversial in its time. In the treatise, Machiavelli explores different types of princedoms and the characteristics of an effective ruler. He discusses the acquisition of new territories, handling internal insurrection, cultivating a strong military, and the importance of appearing virtuous to the public. Certain chapters provide historical examples to illustrate his philosophical points. While seen as highly pragmatic, "The Prince" was also groundbreaking for viewing politics through a scientific lens rather than from a moral standpoint influenced by the Church. Machiavelli essentially separated politics from ethics and religion.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10631.Sam_Walton" target="_blank"><img class="book" src="walton.jpeg" alt="book-walton" width="122" height="180" /></a><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10631.Sam_Walton" target="_blank">Made In America</a></h3>

<p>Sam Walton</p>

<p>Made in America is an autobiographical book written by Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart and Sam's Club. It was first published in 1992, a few months before Walton's death in April 1992 at the age of 74. The book chronicles Walton's life journey, from his humble beginnings growing up during the Great Depression in Oklahoma, to his early career as a franchise owner of Ben Franklin variety stores, and ultimately to founding and building Walmart into the retail giant it became. In the book, Walton shares the core philosophies and business principles that guided him in turning a single dime store in Rogers, Arkansas in 1962 into Walmart - the world's largest retailer and chain of discount department stores. Key tenets included delivering value to customers by keeping costs low, empowering employees, building a strong distribution system, and relentlessly driving for the lowest prices. Walton reveals behind-the-scenes stories of how he lead Walmart's growth through strategies like buying entire trucking operations to cut costs, introducing cutting-edge inventory management technology, and rapidly expanding into new markets across America. He also opens up about professional setbacks and challenges overcome along the way.</p>
