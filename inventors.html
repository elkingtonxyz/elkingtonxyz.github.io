"Rita Levi-Montalcini is a pioneer in neurobiology, studying the mechanism of growth of nerve fibers and the discovery of growth factors.",
"Archimedes is an engineer and inventor, designing machines including compound pulleys and defensive war machines to protect Syracuse from the Romans. Calculating the value of pi, computing the area and volume of spheres and cylinders, laying the foundations for integral calculus, and inventing the Archimedean screw pump. And discovering the principle of buoyancy.",
"As a painter, sculptor, architect, inventor, and student of anatomy, botany, geology, and cartography, Leonardo da Vinci exemplifies the Renaissance spirit. His most famous artworks are the iconic Mona Lisa with her mysterious smile, and the enormous fresco The Last Supper on a wall of the Santa Maria delle Grazie monastery in Milan. His drawings of the human body, completed by meticulous dissection, were centuries ahead of their time in their exactitude.",	
"Jennifer Doudna is a biochemist who has made groundbreaking contributions to the fields of biochemistry and genetics. She is best known for her pioneering work on CRISPR gene editing technology.",
"Nancy Kleckner is a molecular biologist known for her pioneering work on gene transposition and homologous genetic recombination in bacteria. Her discoveries have had a profound impact on the understanding of fundamental cellular processes across all organisms.",
"Tu Youyou is a chemist. Discovering artemisinin (also known as qinghaosu) and dihydroartemisinin, used to treat malaria, which saved millions of lives around the world.",
"John Deere is a blacksmith and manufacturing pioneer who revolutionized agriculture with his steel plow design.",
"George Elkington is a metallurgist and inventor. Pioneering electroplating and electroforming processes.",
"Karl Benz is an engine designer and automotive engineer who patented the first gasoline-powered automobile in 1886.",		
"Dorothy Hodgkin is a chemist best known for her groundbreaking work in X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of biological molecules. Like insulin, penicillin, and vitamin B12.",
